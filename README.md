# Project README

## Description
This project aims to use a DevOps toolchain and Agile Methodology to manage and deliver software .

## DevOps Toolchain
- **Version Control**: We use Git and GitHub for version control to manage our project's source code.
- **Containerization**: Docker Hub is utilized for containerization, allowing us to package our application and its dependencies into containers.
- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Jenkins or Azure DevOps pipelines are employed for automating the build, test, and deployment processes.

## Agile Methodology
We follow Agile principles to manage our project's development:
- **Iterative Development**: Our project progresses through short iterations or sprints, each delivering a potentially shippable increment of software.
- **Scrum or Kanban**: We use Scrum or Kanban boards to visualize our project's progress and manage tasks.
- **Regular Meetings**: Daily stand-up meetings are held to discuss progress, challenges, and plans for the day.
